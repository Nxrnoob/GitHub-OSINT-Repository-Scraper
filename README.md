# OSINT Project

Welcome to my **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Project**! This repository contains tools, scripts, and research focused on gathering and analyzing publicly available information for intelligence purposes.

## 🚀 About the Project
This project is designed to build a **live OSINT tool** that collects, processes, and visualizes data from open sources. The goal is to quickly develop a functional OSINT framework and later refine it into a **research paper** for a hackathon submission.

## ⚡ Features
- **Automated Data Collection**: Gather intelligence from multiple sources (social media, websites, etc.).
- **Data Processing**: Normalize and structure collected data for analysis.
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphs, maps, and reports for better insights.
- **Live Monitoring**: Track changes and updates in real-time.
- **Privacy & Ethical OSINT**: Focus on legal and ethical data gathering practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, OSINT-specific APIs (e.g., Shodan, Hunter.io)
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, NetworkX
- **Deployment**: Docker, Cloud-based infrastructure (if required)

## 📦 Installation
Ensure you are using **Arch Linux** and have a virtual environment set up. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osint-project.git
cd osint-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Usage
Run the OSINT tool using:

```bash
python main.py --target "example.com"
```

For more options:
```bash
python main.py --help
```

## 📑 Roadmap
- [ ] Implement social media intelligence gathering
- [ ] Improve visualization & reporting
- [ ] Optimize for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Write a detailed research paper based on findings

## 🛡️ Legal & Ethical Considerations
This tool is **strictly for educational and research purposes**. Users are responsible for ensuring their activities comply with legal and ethical guidelines.

## 🤝 Contributing
PRs are welcome! Feel free to open an issue for discussion.
