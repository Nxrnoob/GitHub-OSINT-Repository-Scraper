A powerful OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tool that scrapes GitHub repositories based on specific AI/ML-related keywords. It sorts repositories by popularity (stars), filters them by programming language, and allows you to interactively browse and open repositories in your web browserâ€”all from your terminal.

## Features
